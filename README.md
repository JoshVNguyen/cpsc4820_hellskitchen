# TEAM HELL'S KITCHEN
This is the github repository for Team Hell's Kitchen (aka Team Galilei) for our final project in the CPSC 4820 - 3D Game Programming: Algorithms and Techniques at Clemson University (Spring 2020).

## Milestone 1 - Proposal
### The Goal
The goal of our game is a quick battle arena esque game themed around kitchen/cooking. The player is placed in a kitchen/arena with other AI players with the camera being in a static, 3rd person bird's eye view with a slight angle. The arena is filled with collectibles and objects/weapons the player/AI can pick up. These are various kitchen/food items that can be used to attack the other players with. The last player standing wins! We think this game will be a fun game that may possible be implemented with multiplayer (if time permits). It draws inspiration theme-wise from Overcooked.

### Control
The player will have the simple controls of moving with WASD, and using/picking up items with the space/f key. 

### AI
The AI will have different types of script behaviors using pluggable AI scripts. There will be simple moving, targeting, and attacking scripts. 

### Environment and Elements
Scattered throughout the arena are weapons such as frying pans, rolling pins, pies, ketchup bottles, oil, etc. These will spawn around randomly. There will also be structures that the player can manuever around such as cabinets, tables, stoves, chairs, etc. 

### Minimum Viable Product
A game with a moveable player with basic controls and the ability to use weapons.
